# simple-CURD-Operation-DB
A simple project showing the CURD operations using DB concepts and Java Servlet Pages for visualizing.

You will need a server(Tomcat, Glassfish) to host the JSP files and a database server(SQL Developer) to connect the code to your database. Ensure that the localhost while setting
your server is different from your Windows default localhost which is used, which otherwise gives an error.
